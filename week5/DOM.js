// DOM = DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL
//       Object{} that represents the page  that you see in the web browser and
//       provides you with an API to interact with it.
//       The web browse constructs the DOM when it loads the HTML document,
//       and structures all the elements ina tree-like format.
//       Javascript can access and manipulate the DOM to dynamically change the content, structure, and style of a web page.
